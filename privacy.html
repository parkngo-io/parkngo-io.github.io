                <h1>Welcome to our Privacy Policy</h1>
                <h3>Your privacy is critically important to us.</h3>
                <p>It is ParknGo’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website. This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="http://www.parkngo.io">www.parkngo.io</a> (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "www.parkngo.io"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.</p>
                <p>This Privacy Policy, together with the <a href="./terms.html">Terms of service</a> posted on our Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to additional <a target="_blank" href="./terms.html">terms of service</a>.</p>
    
                            <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
                <p>Like most website operators, ParknGo collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. ParknGo’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how ParknGo’s visitors use its website. From time to time, ParknGo may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
                <p>ParknGo also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on http://www.parkngo.io blog posts. ParknGo only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
                
                            <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
                <p>Certain visitors to ParknGo’s websites choose to interact with ParknGo in ways that require ParknGo to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that ParknGo gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at http://www.parkngo.io to provide a username and email address.</p>
                
                            <h2>Security</h2>
                <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
                
                            <h2>Advertisements</h2>
                <p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by ParknGo and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
                
    
                            <h2>Links To External Sites</h2>

                            <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>

                            <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
